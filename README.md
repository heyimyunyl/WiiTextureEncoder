**1) Convert 256x512 folder to SSD**
This option is for albumcoach, coach_1 or any other PNG file with a transparent background. Put your PNG files in `INPUT_256X512` and the output
should be in `OUTPUT_256X512` .

**2) Convert AlbumBKG or square**
If you want to convert squares, albumbkgs or any other texture that doesn't have a transparent background, put your files in
`INPUT_ALBUMBKG` and run this option. Your converted textures will be in the same folder. Don't forget that your original files will be deleted
once you convert them.
